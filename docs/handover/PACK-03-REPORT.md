# CLAUDE-PACK-03 — Participation and Decision Kernel: Handover Report

**Revision 3.** Revision 1's local-only verification was followed by a
real external GitHub Actions run, which found one genuine mypy error
(section 0a) — fixed, then a second external run found four more, all
the same underlying bug pattern in a different service (section 0b).
Both are now fixed at the source and the full local verification suite
was re-run clean after each.

```text
PACK-03: LOCAL VERIFICATION PASS (revision 3) — full PASS pending
GitHub Actions network-dependent steps (uv.lock / package-lock.json
regeneration, hypothesis-gated property tests, npm install / ESLint /
TypeScript build)
```

Per this pack's own instruction ("do not mark PASS if network-dependent
lock regeneration or any verification step could not be completed"),
this report does not claim an unconditional PASS. Every check this
sandbox can genuinely execute has been run and passes (section 6); the
remaining gap is identical in kind, and narrower in scope, to the one
`docs/handover/PACK-02-REPORT.md` documented and later closed externally
(section 3): this sandbox's network egress still blocks `pypi.org` /
`files.pythonhosted.org` / `registry.npmjs.org` (`403`, reconfirmed this
pass), so `uv lock`, `uv sync`, and `npm install` cannot run here, and the
`hypothesis` package (needed only by `tests/contract/test_property_based.py`,
unchanged by this pack) cannot be installed or exercised locally. The
stated remaining step is the same one PACK-02 ultimately took: run
`.github/workflows/verify-and-package.yml` on GitHub Actions with real
network access, then diff the returned tree against the sent tree
file-by-file before accepting it.

## 0a. External verification finding and fix (revision 2)

External verification on GitHub Actions (running against the revision-1
candidate archive) reported one real mypy error, with everything before
it in the pipeline (Ruff format, Prettier, Ruff lint, frontend ESLint,
mypy for `epd2-core`/`scripts`/`tests/repository`/`conftest.py`) already
passing:

```text
tests/contract/test_ct00_02_unknown_status.py:146: error: "Exception"
has no attribute "reason_code"  [attr-defined]
```

Root cause: `test_pack03_unknown_enum_value_is_rejected` is one
parametrized test covering all 18 PACK-03 status/value enums'
`Unknown*Error` exception classes across six services — those classes
share no common concrete base beyond `ValueError`, so the test parameter
`expected_exception` is typed as the generic `type[Exception]`. Passing
that generic type into `pytest.raises(expected_exception)` makes
`excinfo.value` resolve to plain `Exception`, which has no
`reason_code` attribute — only the concrete `Unknown*Error` subclasses
do. This is genuinely invisible in this sandbox: the project's own mypy
config carries `ignore_missing_imports = true` for `pytest`/`_pytest.*`
(documented in `pyproject.toml`, originally added because this sandbox's
standalone mypy tool has no `pytest` installed to find real stubs for),
so locally `pytest.raises(...)` resolves to `Any` and the attribute
access never gets checked at all — the same category of "invisible
locally, real once genuine stubs are installed" gap
`docs/handover/PACK-02-REPORT.md` section 0d already documented for
Hypothesis.

Fixed at the source, with no blanket `# type: ignore` and no relaxed
mypy setting: added a `@runtime_checkable` `Protocol` (`_ReasonCodedError`,
declaring `reason_code: str`) to
`tests/contract/test_ct00_02_unknown_status.py`, and narrowed the caught
exception against it before accessing the attribute:

```python
error = excinfo.value
assert isinstance(error, _ReasonCodedError)
assert error.reason_code == "VALIDATION_UNKNOWN_STATUS"
```

This is option 2 of the two the pack's own instruction allowed ("narrow
the caught exception before accessing `reason_code`") — option 1 (naming
one concrete exception type per case) was not available without
introducing a new shared exception base class across eleven services'
`exceptions.py` modules, a materially larger and riskier change than this
test file needed. The `isinstance()` check is a genuine runtime
assertion, not a no-op: `@runtime_checkable` protocols check for the
declared attribute's actual presence on the instance
(`hasattr`-equivalent, confirmed directly this pass with a throwaway
script — a plain `ValueError` without `reason_code` correctly fails the
isinstance check), so if any of the 18 `Unknown*Error` classes ever
stopped declaring `reason_code`, this test would fail loudly rather than
silently pass. Mypy narrows `error`'s static type to a synthesized
intersection of `Exception` and `_ReasonCodedError` after the assert
(confirmed directly this pass via `reveal_type`), which is exactly what
makes the following `.reason_code` access type-check. The assertion this
test makes — that an unknown status value produces
`reason_code == "VALIDATION_UNKNOWN_STATUS"` — is unchanged and still
genuinely executed for all 18 cases.

`.github/workflows/verify-and-package.yml` was not touched — the fix is
entirely inside the one test file that had the bug. This sandbox still
cannot install real `pytest`/`_pytest.*` stubs to reproduce CI's exact
failure locally (same root cause as the bug itself), so this fix was
verified as far as this environment allows: `mypy tests/contract` still
reports "Success: no issues found in 18 source files" (unchanged — this
sandbox's config never saw the error in the first place), and a
standalone, throwaway repro file using a hand-written `Exception`-typed
variable (not going through `pytest.raises`, to sidestep the
`ignore_missing_imports` masking) confirmed both halves directly:
accessing `.reason_code` on a bare `Exception`-typed variable fails
`attr-defined` exactly as CI reported, and the same access after
`assert isinstance(error, _ReasonCodedError)` type-checks cleanly with
mypy narrowing to the intersection type. Full confirmation that the real
CI error is gone requires the next external GitHub Actions run.

## 0b. External verification finding and fix (revision 3)

A subsequent external GitHub Actions run — against the revision-2
candidate archive — passed everything through the section 0a fix (Ruff
format, Prettier, Ruff lint, frontend ESLint, mypy for
`epd2-core`/`scripts`/`tests/repository`/`conftest.py`, mypy for
`audit-core`), then found four real mypy errors, all in one file:

```text
services/initiative-service/tests/test_domain.py:133: error: Value of
type "object" is not indexable  [index]
services/initiative-service/tests/test_domain.py:274: error: Value of
type "object" is not indexable  [index]
services/initiative-service/tests/test_domain.py:330: error: Value of
type "object" is not indexable  [index]
services/initiative-service/tests/test_domain.py:375: error: Value of
type "object" is not indexable  [index]
```

Root cause: all four flagged lines were `@pytest.mark.parametrize`
decorators of the form
`sorted(ALLOWED_*_TRANSITIONS, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))` — one per
owned entity (`Initiative`, `SupportRecord`, `Amendment`, `SourceRecord`).
Reproduced directly this pass with a hand-written stand-in for pytest's
real `parametrize` signature (`argvalues: Iterable[Sequence[object] |
object]`, closely matching the real stub, in a throwaway file, since this
sandbox's own mypy config masks real `pytest` via `ignore_missing_imports`
exactly as section 0a described): when `sorted(...)`'s result is passed
as an argument into a call whose parameter is typed with that broad
`Sequence[object] | object` element type, mypy's bidirectional inference
pushes that expected type down into the lambda, and the lambda parameter
`p` types as `object` instead of the correct
`tuple[SomeStatus, SomeStatus]` inferred from `ALLOWED_*_TRANSITIONS`
itself — so `p[0]`/`p[1]` fail `object` is not indexable. Confirmed with
a second throwaway repro that removing the `key=` argument entirely
avoids the broken inference path completely and type-checks cleanly.

The `key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1])` was always a no-op: for a 2-tuple `p`,
`(p[0], p[1])` is exactly `p` itself, so this key function does not
change the sort order at all — `sorted(x, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))`
and `sorted(x)` are the same operation whenever `x`'s elements are
themselves comparable 2-tuples (true here: every `ALLOWED_*_TRANSITIONS`
is declared as `frozenset[tuple[SomeStatus, SomeStatus]]`, and every
`SomeStatus` is a `StrEnum`, which supports ordering). Fixed by deleting
the redundant `key=` argument at all four flagged lines, leaving
`sorted(ALLOWED_*_TRANSITIONS)` — not a cast, not a blanket ignore, and
not a behavior change: confirmed programmatically this pass, for each of
the four affected sets, that `sorted(x, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1])) ==
sorted(x)` (`True` in all four cases, with the documented edge counts:
28 initiative, 2 support, 11 amendment, 13 source-verification
transitions), so the parametrized test cases and their order are
byte-for-byte unchanged — this satisfies the pack's requirement to
preserve existing assertions and test meaning exactly, while removing
the operation mypy correctly flagged as unsafe under real pytest stubs.

While fixing this, the identical `sorted(ALLOWED_*, key=lambda p: (p[0],
p[1]))` pattern was found, unprompted by the CI report, in four more
places across three other PACK-03 services —
`services/voting-service/tests/test_domain.py` (4 occurrences: `Ballot`,
`BallotOption`, `VoteEnvelope`, `VoteReceipt`),
`services/delegation-service/tests/test_domain.py` (1: `Delegation`),
and `services/tally-service/tests/test_domain.py` (1: `Tally`
verification status) — the same sub-agent-authored pattern, copied
across services when each service's own transition-table test was
written. These had not yet been reached by CI's per-service mypy
ordering, but are the exact same latent bug and would have failed the
next run regardless. Fixed identically (redundant `key=` removed) and
verified programmatically the same way: `sorted(x, key=lambda p: (p[0],
p[1])) == sorted(x)` for all six additional sets (`True` in every case).
Ten occurrences fixed in total this revision, not four — closing this
whole bug class in one pass rather than trickling in one CI round at a
time.

`.github/workflows/verify-and-package.yml` was not touched. This
sandbox's own `mypy services/initiative-service` (and the five other
affected services) reported "Success: no issues found" both before and
after this fix — the bug is invisible here for the same
`ignore_missing_imports`-on-`pytest` reason as section 0a, which is
exactly why the two throwaway repro files above (using a hand-written
stand-in for pytest's real signature, not a real pytest import) were used
to reproduce and confirm the fix locally as far as this environment
allows. The full local verification suite (section 6) was re-run clean
after this fix: 1518 passed, 3 skipped, 0 failed — unchanged from
revision 2, confirming zero test-behavior change.

## 0. What CLAUDE-PACK-03 adds

Six new Python services, each an independent `uv` workspace member with
its own `pyproject.toml`, `src/`, and `tests/`, implementing the 18
in-scope canonical entities for participation and decision-making:

- `services/initiative-service` (`epd2_initiative_service`) — owns
  `Initiative`, `InitiativeVersion`, `SupportRecord`, `Amendment`,
  `SourceRecord`.
- `services/deliberation-service` (`epd2_deliberation_service`) — owns
  `Discussion`, `Contribution`.
- `services/moderation-service` (`epd2_moderation_service`) — owns
  `ModerationCase`, `ModerationDecision`, `Appeal`.
- `services/voting-service` (`epd2_voting_service`) — owns `Ballot`,
  `BallotOption`, `VoteEnvelope`, `VoteReceipt`.
- `services/tally-service` (`epd2_tally_service`) — owns `Tally`,
  `ResultPublication`.
- `services/delegation-service` (`epd2_delegation_service`) — owns
  `Delegation`, `DelegationSnapshot`.

Plus: five accepted ADRs already present in this tree
(`docs/adr/ADR-005-pack-03-service-decomposition.md`,
`ADR-006-pack-03-reason-code-additions.md`,
`ADR-008-pack-03-pack-02-integration-boundary.md`,
`ADR-009-voting-delegation-quorum-defaults.md`,
`ADR-010-ballot-challenge-window-canon-addition.md`), a separate 70-entry
reason-code registry (`contracts/reason-codes/pack-03.yml`, ADR-006
Option B — never merged with `pack-02.yml`), 18 entity JSON Schemas and
18 event-payload JSON Schemas in `contracts/schemas/` /
`contracts/events/`, a 71-path OpenAPI contract
(`contracts/openapi/pack-03.yaml`), the CT-00-01 through CT-00-10
contract-test suite extended to cover all six services (CT-00-11/12
remain documented not-applicable, unchanged from PACK-02, since neither
`AIProcessingRecord` nor `EmergencyAction` is in scope for PACK-03
either), and a repository-wide structural boundary test
(`tests/repository/test_service_boundaries.py`) enforcing ADR-008's
narrow, `.application`-only PACK-03 → PACK-02 read edge with no
PACK-02 → PACK-03 dependency and no PACK-03 ↔ PACK-03 cross-service
imports.

## 1. Environment and network status

```text
$ python3 --version
Python 3.11.15
$ python3.12 --version
Python 3.12.3
```

This sandbox's network egress blocks `pypi.org` / `files.pythonhosted.org`
/ `registry.npmjs.org` (`403`), reconfirmed directly this pass:

```text
$ curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://registry.npmjs.org/
403
$ curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://pypi.org/
403
```

No standalone `uv`-synced project venv exists in this sandbox for the
same reason. Local verification instead used the pre-existing standalone
tool binaries at `/root/.local/share/uv/tools/{pytest,mypy}/bin/` and
`/root/.local/bin/ruff`, plus the system `python3`/`python3.12`
interpreters (each with a real, already-installed `PyYAML` and
`jsonschema` — not network-fetched this session) and a system-installed
Prettier 3.8.1 (found available outside the project's own blocked
`npm install` path, the same discovery `docs/handover/PACK-02-REPORT.md`
section 0c made). `node_modules` does not exist in this tree; PACK-03
makes no frontend/TypeScript source change (only the `REPOSITORY_VERSION`
mirror in `packages/typescript/epd2-types/src/version.ts`, section 2), so
`npm run typecheck`, ESLint, the TypeScript unit tests, and `next build`
were not run locally — consistent with every one of PACK-02's early
revisions, before GitHub Actions' real network access closed that gap.

One improvement over PACK-02's local-verification ceiling: pointing
`PYTHONPATH` at the system `python3`'s `dist-packages` directory
(`/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages`, which already carries a real
`PyYAML` and `jsonschema`) in addition to all twelve workspace `src/`
directories let the standalone `pytest` tool run every YAML/JSON-Schema-
dependent test for real this pass, instead of `pytest.importorskip`-ing
them. The only test that still cannot run locally is
`tests/contract/test_property_based.py` (needs `hypothesis`, which is
genuinely absent from this sandbox and not present in any local cache —
confirmed by `find /` turning up no installable wheel or importable
module anywhere on the filesystem).

## 2. Canon integrity

`docs/canonical/TZ-00-domain-event-canon.md` was not opened for editing
this pass and was re-verified byte-identical both before and after every
change in this pass (prettier run, reason-code generation, mypy/ruff
fixes):

```text
sha256(docs/canonical/TZ-00-domain-event-canon.md) =
  5ed52c3a6a94e821323616ac369595fd364a71115cf5c1c6763d8edb51a6044a
```

This matches the value fixed at the start of this task and must never
change. `CANON_VERSION` remains `"0.2.0"` everywhere it is declared
(`epd2_core/version.py`, `epd2-types/version.ts`,
`docs/canonical/canon-version.json`) — PACK-03 adds one narrow,
ADR-010-accepted canon addition (`Ballot.challenge_window_hours`,
`ResultPublication.challenge_deadline_at`) but does not bump
`CANON_VERSION` itself, per ADR-010's own framing of this as an additive,
backward-compatible field addition rather than a new canon version.

`REPOSITORY_VERSION` was bumped `0.2.0` → `0.3.0`
(`packages/python/epd2-core/src/epd2_core/version.py`,
`packages/typescript/epd2-types/src/version.ts`, both tests' expected
values, `CHANGELOG.md`'s newest entry), enforced by
`scripts/verify_versions.py`, which passes.
`docs/canonical/canon-version.json`'s `repository_compatibility` field
(repository-side bookkeeping, not canon-immutable content) was widened
from `">=0.1.0 <0.3.0"` to `">=0.1.0 <0.4.0"` to admit the new repository
version.

## 3. Lock files — open (same class of gap as PACK-02, narrower in scope)

```text
uv.lock:            NOT regenerated — `uv lock` fails in this sandbox,
                     network egress to pypi.org/files.pythonhosted.org
                     is blocked (403, reconfirmed section 1); PACK-03
                     adds no new third-party Python dependency beyond
                     what PACK-02 already required (jsonschema,
                     types-PyYAML — both already pinned), so the only
                     unresolved question a real `uv lock` run answers is
                     whether the twelve-workspace-member resolution is
                     itself consistent, not whether a new package
                     exists.
package-lock.json:  NOT touched — PACK-03 is backend-only; no npm
                     dependency was added, removed, or changed.
```

No source code, test, or check was changed to route around this gap, and
no hand-written lock file was substituted for a real one. Per this pack's
own instruction not to mark PASS while this is true, and per the
established remediation path from PACK-02 (`docs/handover/PACK-02-REPORT.md`
section 3): the next step is running
`.github/workflows/verify-and-package.yml` via **Actions → Verify and
Package → Run workflow** on a fork/clone with real GitHub Actions network
access, then diffing the returned tree against the exact tree sent for
verification, file-by-file, before accepting the regenerated `uv.lock`.

## 4. Files added or changed this pass

New:

- `services/initiative-service/`, `services/deliberation-service/`,
  `services/moderation-service/`, `services/voting-service/`,
  `services/tally-service/`, `services/delegation-service/` — full
  `src/`, `tests/`, `pyproject.toml`, `README.md` each.
- `contracts/reason-codes/pack-03.yml` (70 entries).
- `contracts/schemas/*.json` (18 new PACK-03 entity schemas),
  `contracts/events/*.json` (18 new PACK-03 event-payload schemas),
  `contracts/openapi/pack-03.yaml` (71 paths).
- `tests/contract/test_ct00_*.py`, `test_state_transitions.py` — extended
  in place to cover all eleven PACK-02+PACK-03 services (CT-00-01
  through CT-00-10); `test_ct00_11_12_not_applicable.py` updated with
  PACK-03-scoped justification text.
- `tests/repository/test_service_boundaries.py` — rewritten (see
  section 5) to enforce the ADR-008 edge at the dotted-module-path
  level, not just the root-package level.
- `docs/handover/PACK-03-REPORT.md` — this report.

Changed:

- `services/eligibility-service/src/epd2_eligibility_service/application.py`
  — added `get_eligibility_decision` and `get_eligibility_snapshot`, two
  plain, unaudited read functions under ADR-008's narrow
  PACK-03 → PACK-02 `.application`-only edge (with matching tests and a
  new README section).
- Root `pyproject.toml` — `[project.dependencies]`,
  `[tool.uv.workspace].members` (now 12), `[tool.uv.sources]`,
  `[tool.ruff].src`, `[tool.ruff.lint.isort].known-first-party`,
  `[tool.mypy].mypy_path`, `[tool.pytest.ini_options].testpaths` — all
  extended for the six new services.
- `Makefile` — `typecheck` target extended with one scoped
  `mypy services/<name>` line per new service (same one-invocation-per-
  non-colliding-basename-group pattern PACK-02 established, section 5 of
  that report).
- `scripts/check_repository.py` — `REQUIRED_PATHS` extended with all new
  ADR, contract, schema, and per-service paths (277 total, all present —
  section 6).
- `packages/python/epd2-core/src/epd2_core/version.py`,
  `packages/typescript/epd2-types/src/version.ts` and their tests,
  `docs/canonical/canon-version.json`, `CHANGELOG.md` — version bump,
  section 2.
- 14 files reformatted with a real Prettier binary this pass (content
  unchanged, whitespace/formatting only): `CHANGELOG.md`, 5
  `contracts/events/*.v1.schema.json` PACK-03 files,
  `contracts/openapi/pack-03.yaml`, `contracts/reason-codes/pack-03.yml`,
  and 6 PACK-03 service `README.md` files
  (`delegation-service`, `deliberation-service`, `initiative-service`,
  `moderation-service`, `tally-service`, `voting-service`).
  `docs/canonical/TZ-00-domain-event-canon.md` was not among them and its
  SHA-256 is unchanged (section 2).

Not changed: `docs/canonical/TZ-00-domain-event-canon.md` (byte-identical,
section 2); `package.json` / `package-lock.json` (no npm-side change,
section 3); `frontend/web-shell/`; any of the five PACK-02 services'
`src/` (only `eligibility-service/application.py` gained the two new
read functions above — no existing PACK-02 behavior was altered).

Changed in revision 2 (section 0a):

- `tests/contract/test_ct00_02_unknown_status.py` — added a
  `@runtime_checkable` `Protocol` (`_ReasonCodedError`) and narrowed
  `test_pack03_unknown_enum_value_is_rejected`'s caught exception against
  it via `isinstance()` before accessing `.reason_code`, fixing the one
  real mypy error external GitHub Actions verification found.
- `docs/handover/PACK-03-REPORT.md` — this revision.

Changed in revision 3 (section 0b):

- `services/initiative-service/tests/test_domain.py` (4 sites),
  `services/voting-service/tests/test_domain.py` (4 sites),
  `services/delegation-service/tests/test_domain.py` (1 site),
  `services/tally-service/tests/test_domain.py` (1 site) — removed the
  redundant, no-op `key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1])` argument from each
  `sorted(ALLOWED_*_TRANSITIONS, ...)` call feeding a
  `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator, fixing the four real mypy errors
  external GitHub Actions verification found (plus six identical latent
  occurrences found while fixing them, section 0b).
- `docs/handover/PACK-03-REPORT.md` — this revision.

## 5. Gaps found and fixed during this pass's own verification

Recorded here in full, per this pack's demand for honest verification,
rather than folded silently into the file list above:

1. **The reason-code registry test originally scanned all eleven
   services against only `pack-02.yml`.** `tests/contract/test_reason_codes_registry.py`
   pre-existed this pass scoped to PACK-02's five services; once PACK-03's
   six services landed in `services/`, a naive extension would have
   scanned them against the wrong registry. Fixed by parametrizing the
   test over `(pack_name, registry_path, service_dir_names,
minimum_size)` so PACK-02 services check against `pack-02.yml` and
   PACK-03 services check against `pack-03.yml` independently — each
   pack's registry remains a complete, standalone source of truth for
   its own services, per ADR-006 Option B.
2. **The structural boundary test needed a finer edge than "which
   package did you import."** PACK-02's own
   `tests/repository/test_service_boundaries.py` checked root package
   names only, which is too coarse for ADR-008: PACK-03 services are
   allowed to import specific `.application`-scoped functions from
   specific PACK-02 services, but never their `.storage` or `.domain`
   modules, and never each other. Fixed by adding
   `_imported_module_paths()` (full dotted-path AST inspection, not just
   root-package names) alongside the existing `_imported_roots()`, and
   five explicit test functions covering both PACK-02's own one-way
   dependency rule and every new PACK-03 edge — all five pass against
   the real codebase.
3. **Sub-agent-authored PACK-03 contract test extensions repeatedly put
   new imports mid-file instead of at the top**, producing 119 Ruff
   `E402` errors across ten files. Fixed file-by-file (manual `Edit` for
   `test_state_transitions.py`; a small one-off AST-based script,
   deleted after use, for the other eight `test_ct00_*.py` files),
   followed by `ruff check . --fix` for import ordering.
4. **mypy strict mode surfaced twelve real, previously-unchecked errors**
   once the new contract-test and deliberation-service test helpers were
   type-checked for real: missing parameter annotations
   (`test_ct00_02/05/06_*.py`), a `dict[str, object]`-typed helper
   returning `Any` where `dict[str, object]` was declared
   (`test_ct00_08_identity_leakage.py`), a `Union[...]` attribute access
   needing per-branch `# type: ignore` instead of one blanket comment
   (`test_state_transitions.py`), and — the largest of these — two
   deliberation-service test helpers (`_setup_contribution`,
   `_make_contribution` in both `test_domain.py` and `test_storage.py`)
   whose `**overrides: object` splat pattern left `content`/
   `contribution_type` typed as bare `object` when passed into
   `compute_contribution_content_hash(content: str, contribution_type:
ContributionType)`. Fixed by narrowing with explicit
   `isinstance(...)` assertions before use (mirroring the existing
   `_setup_contribution` return-type fix already applied to
   `test_application.py`) rather than adding another blanket
   `# type: ignore`; this also resolved four stale, now-`unused-ignore`
   comments the strict `warn_unused_ignores = true` setting was
   correctly flagging as errors in their own right. All twelve fixed for
   real; none suppressed with a bare ignore.
5. **Prettier had never actually been run against this pass's new
   files.** Running the system Prettier 3.8.1 binary (available outside
   the project's own network-blocked `npm install` path — same discovery
   PACK-02 made in its own revision 3) found 14 genuinely
   non-Prettier-compliant files (section 4). Fixed with `prettier
--write .`; canon checksum reconfirmed byte-identical before and
   after (section 2).

## 6. Commands executed this pass, and results

### Revision 3 re-verification (current, source of truth)

Full local verification suite re-run end to end after the section 0b
fix, from a clean state. Results are identical to revision 2's own

```

### Revision 1's original verification (historical, for the record)

Identical results to revision 2 above, except
`tests/contract/test_ct00_02_unknown_status.py` did not yet have the
section 0a fix — this sandbox's own `mypy tests/contract` run reported
"Success: no issues found in 18 source files" then too (the bug was
invisible locally both before and after the fix, section 0a), and the
full local pytest count was the same 1518 passed / 3 skipped / 0 failed,
since the fix changed only type annotations and an added runtime
`isinstance` assertion that always evaluates `True` for every real
`Unknown*Error` instance in this codebase — no test behavior changed.

### Why 3 tests are skipped, not failing

```text
SKIPPED  tests/contract/test_property_based.py                 (no hypothesis)
SKIPPED  tests/contract/test_ct00_11_12_not_applicable.py (2 tests)
```

The first is a `pytest.importorskip("hypothesis")` guard: this sandbox
cannot install `hypothesis` at all (section 1) — CI's `uv sync
--all-groups` installs it and PACK-02's own GitHub Actions run already
confirmed this module runs and passes for real once it is present; PACK-03
made no change to this file. The remaining two are genuine, scope-level
**not-applicable** markers, unchanged from PACK-02: CT-00-11
(AI-produced-result human-control gate) and CT-00-12
(forbidden-operation-during-freeze) both require canon entities
(`AIProcessingRecord`, `EmergencyAction`) that are explicitly out of
scope for both PACK-02 and PACK-03 — there is nothing in either pack for
either test to exercise, and `test_ct00_11_12_not_applicable.py`
documents why rather than silently omitting them from the suite.

## 7. Repository boundary enforcement (ADR-008)

`tests/repository/test_service_boundaries.py` enforces, against the real
codebase's AST (not a hand-maintained list asserted to be true):

- No PACK-02 service imports another PACK-02 service's package (except
  every service's existing, unchanged dependency on `epd2_audit_core`)
  — PACK-02's own pre-existing rule, reconfirmed unbroken.
- No PACK-03 service imports another PACK-03 service's package.
  `initiative-service`, `deliberation-service`, `moderation-service`,
  `voting-service`, `tally-service`, and `delegation-service` are
  mutually independent; each depends only on its own package,
  `epd2_core`, and `epd2_audit_core`.
- No PACK-02 service imports any PACK-03 service — the dependency edge
  is strictly one-directional.
- Every PACK-03 → PACK-02 import is limited to the exact
  `.application`-scoped module paths ADR-008 names
  (`ALLOWED_PACK03_TO_PACK02_APPLICATION_MODULES`) — never a `.storage`
  or `.domain` import, and never an unlisted PACK-02 service. This is
  what makes `epd2_eligibility_service.application.get_eligibility_decision`
  / `get_eligibility_snapshot` (section 4) necessary: without them,
  `voting-service` and `initiative-service` would have no ADR-008-legal
  way to read eligibility state at all.
- `epd2_audit_core` itself imports neither PACK-02 nor PACK-03 domain
  services.

All five checks pass against the real, current codebase — none is
currently vacuous (each PACK-03 service genuinely does import at least
one allowed PACK-02 `.application` function where the pack's own spec
requires it, so the "narrow edge, not zero edge" distinction is actually
exercised).

## 8. Voting, delegation, and finality rules (ADR-009 / ADR-010)

Enforced in `services/voting-service`, `services/tally-service`, and
`services/delegation-service`, each backed by dedicated domain/application
tests:

- Vote changes are allowed until a ballot closes; only the latest valid
  `VoteEnvelope` per voter counts (superseding, not accumulating).
- Abstention is an explicit `BallotOption`, never an implicit "no
  envelope" state.
- Pilot ballot methods are restricted to single-choice and yes/no
  (`BallotMethod`); no ranked or weighted method is reachable this pack.
- Quorum is optional per ballot (`quorum_rule` may be `"none"`).
- Configuring a ballot requires second-actor approval — the actor who
  created a ballot cannot also be the one who approves its
  configuration (enforced in `voting-service`'s application layer, tested
  in `tests/contract/test_ct00_06_missing_permission.py`).
- Delegation is disabled by default and capped at depth 1, enforced
  bidirectionally in `delegation-service`'s domain layer (a delegation
  cannot be created if it would make any chain, in either direction,
  exceed depth 1).
- A direct vote always overrides a delegated one.
- A tie produces `ThresholdResult.TIE_NO_DECISION` — never a
  silently-broken tie.
- `Ballot.challenge_window_hours` defaults to 72
  (`DEFAULT_CHALLENGE_WINDOW_HOURS`) and is configurable per ballot
  (ADR-010).
- `ResultPublication`'s finality state is one of exactly
  `PROVISIONAL_BEFORE_DEADLINE` or
  `PROVISIONAL_PENDING_CHALLENGE_MECHANISM` — `compute_finality_state`
  has no code path that returns anything resembling "final"; there is no
  automatic-production-finality state in this pack, per ADR-010's own
  clarification.
- No PACK-03-accessible command reaches `BallotStatus.INVALIDATED` —
  confirmed by an AST-based test walking every `voting-service`
  application function's reachable status transitions, not merely
  asserted.

## 9. Identity separation and vote-linkability (structural, not

cryptographic)

`VoteEnvelope`, `VoteReceipt`, `Tally`, `ResultPublication`,
`SupportRecord`, `Delegation`, and `DelegationSnapshot` each declare
`additionalProperties: false` in their JSON Schema and are checked
against a `FORBIDDEN_FIELD_NAMES` frozenset (no `account_id`,
`person_id`, or `identity_record_id` field, and no schema property that
would let one be added) — the same structural pattern PACK-02 established
for `ParticipationCredential` (CT-00-08), extended here to every
PACK-03 entity that touches a vote, a delegation, or a support signature.
`tests/contract/test_ct00_08_identity_leakage.py` and
`test_ct00_09_vote_linkability.py` exercise this for all eleven
PACK-02+PACK-03 services, including a positive-space regression test
(mirroring PACK-02's own, section 0a of that report) confirming that
identity-service's own OpenAPI paths still legitimately declare
`identity_record_id` — proving the forbidden-field scan is scoped
correctly rather than passing vacuously. As with PACK-02, this is an
explicitly **structural** guarantee (no field, no shared ID, no schema
property, no reverse-lookup path from a vote back to an account) — not a
cryptographic-anonymity or unlinkability-under-collusion claim.

## 10. Reason-code registry

`contracts/reason-codes/pack-03.yml`: 70 entries — 14 canon-sourced (9
PACK-03-relevant canon section-24 codes plus 5 reused generics:
`PERMISSION_DENIED`, `EVENT_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED`,
`INTEGRITY_CHECK_FAILED`, `SERVICE_STATE_READ_ONLY`,
`EMERGENCY_FREEZE_ACTIVE`), 3 validation-generic additive codes
(mirroring `pack-02.yml`'s own pattern), and 53 PACK-03-additive codes
across all six services (ADR-006). This is a separate, non-overlapping
file from `contracts/reason-codes/pack-02.yml` (ADR-006 Option B) — codes
both packs need, such as `PERMISSION_DENIED`, are independently
redeclared in each registry rather than shared by import. Every reason
code actually used in a PACK-03 service's `raise ...Error(reason_code=...)`
call is checked against this registry by the pack-parametrized
`tests/contract/test_reason_codes_registry.py` (section 5, gap 1) — this
pass confirmed, both via that test (now running for real, not
sandbox-skipped, section 1) and via a direct `yaml.safe_load` cross-check,
that all 65 actually-used PACK-03 codes are present in the registry.

## 11. Readiness conclusion

```text
PACK-03: LOCAL VERIFICATION PASS (revision 3)
uv.lock / npm install: NOT YET REGENERATED (network-blocked, section 3)
```

Every check this sandbox can genuinely execute passes: 277 of 277
required paths present, no forbidden paths, all version sources
consistent, Ruff lint and format clean, a real Prettier format check
clean, mypy clean across all thirteen scoped groups (133 source files,
zero errors, zero suppressed via blanket ignores), 1518 passing Python
tests with 0 failures and exactly 3 genuine skips (1 missing-dependency,
2 documented not-applicable — zero unexplained skips), and JSON/YAML
validity across every one of the 67 contract files in this repository.
`docs/canonical/TZ-00-domain-event-canon.md` remains byte-identical to
the fixed value this task began with throughout (section 2). No check
was weakened, no empty file was written to satisfy a path requirement, no
reason code was hidden, no identity field was stripped from a service's
own contract to make a test pass, and no unlinkability claim is made
without the automated test that backs it (section 9).

This revision incorporates two real fixes surfaced across two rounds of
external GitHub Actions verification — a generic-exception-typed
attribute access in a parametrized contract test (section 0a), and a
redundant, mypy-unsafe sort key repeated across ten call sites in four
services (section 0b) — each closed with a precise, source-level fix
(a type-safe `isinstance` narrowing; a no-op key's removal, verified
programmatically to change no test outcome) and no blanket suppression,
with `.github/workflows/verify-and-package.yml` left untouched both
times.

The one thing standing between this repository and PACK-03's full
Definition of Done — exactly as PACK-02 documented and then closed — is a
real `uv lock` / `npm install` run against genuine network access,
followed by the same file-by-file diff-before-accept discipline this
project has followed since the PACK-01 incident. This report records an
honest, currently-true **local** PASS and an explicitly open, narrowly
scoped, already-precedented network gap — not a final PASS.
